		<h3 class="headline">Biscuit Tractor Biography</h3>
		<p>Hi I'm a baker, I love bread and farming and yogurt. My dreams are lofty, and my outlook is darkened by the societal shadows casted upon hopeful glees of spirited sanity. Quiet time is filled with the crackle of newly caramelized crusted conceptions of life. These are my children, to be chewed and churned by the butter of life, for the betterment of shrubs, tall grasses, and root vegetables. Ferment, fervor, forever.</p>

			<h4 class="headline">Biscuit</h4>
			<p class="recipes">Flour, butter, leavening, salt, sugar, buttermilk.<br><br>Keep the butter cold, sift together your soul's dryness. Cut into it with thumbs pressing against index fingers. Rub rhythmatically. Gently fold the angelic dough with buttermilk. Move quickly, keep the chill running down your spine. Use a sharp object. Bake at high heat. Eat when golden and flakey to your taste.</p>

			<h4 class="headline">Cinnamon Roll</h4>
			<p class="recipes">Sweet potatoes, flour, brown butter, sugar, brown sugar, salt, spices, yeast, milk, eggs, and tears.<br><br>Put it all in the bowl, except the butter. Turn it on. Keep the hook spiraling on the lowest speed. Don't take your eyes off the transformation. Watch for smoothness and that intuition kicking in. Add the cold butter slowly. Let rise, fold down, let rise again. Smooth, smear, roll, and slice. Let rise up, bake, frost, and don't let anyone put you down. <br>Rise! Resist! Roll!</p>
